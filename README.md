Redstone Flux API
====================================

This is an updated version of the COFH redstone flux API that I have used in my 1.8 mod Progressive Automation.
If you also have a 1.8 mod then I recommend that you use this version so that our mods work together!

Original Text:
This is the standalone CoFH Energy API - also known as the "Redstone Flux" API.

Make great use of it.

You are of course free to modify any/all of this code and even repackage it, but then it wouldn't be an awesome crossmod API anymore, now would it?

Don't be a jerk.
